# Module 13 + 14 Project: Just Tech News

## Description
Over the course of two weeks, we created a CMS-style blog site called "Just Tech News" to learn about Object Relational Mapping and the Model-View-Controller paradigm. First, we used the Sequelize ORM to modularize the process of writing SQL queries in an application built with Node.js. After completing the back end, we used the templating engine Handlebars.js to render dynamic HTML, structured the code to follow the MVC paradigm, then added user authentication to round out this full stack app.

## Overview of Concepts Learned
* How to implement the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application  
* How to define models that use datatype validations  
* Implementing CRUD methods using Sequelize to interact with your models in each API endpoint through proper RESTful commands  
* Implementing Sequelize associations to join one or more tables  
* How to configure Heroku for deployment of an application using Sequelize and MySQL  
* How to use the bcrypt package to hash password information and use environment variables to protect sensitive data  
* How to render dynamic HTML using the Handlebars.js template engine  
* Implementing MVC modularization in a full-stack web application  
* The interaction between the Model, View, and Controller  
* Understanding separation of concerns and its benefits  
* Implementing user authentication  

## Built With
